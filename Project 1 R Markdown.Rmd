# Introduction  
In this vignette, we're going to be taking a look at the PokeAPI, writing some functions to interact with it.  
  
# Requirements  
For the work done here, we will be using the `tidyverse` package for all of our data manipulation, the `httr` package for making https requests to the API and `jsonlite` for interacting with json files. The code chunk for loading in these packages is included below  
  
```{r packages, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```
